# Ticket-Query
a web application to create and retrieve tickets





Jeff Burditt:
If you're looking for sole completion of this programming test, then I'll save you your time as I must regretfully inform that I was unable to fulfill all the requirements by the deadline. If however, you are curious to see my potential to learn and grow in an environment I am simply self taught in, then I believe this assignment reflects that. I found this project to be exciting as I got exposed to many new frameworks, which allowed me to grow in my understandin of web development. I believe this project is best representative of my passion for what I do, as well as my ability to grow into a new area of computer science.

I hope to hear from you soon.
